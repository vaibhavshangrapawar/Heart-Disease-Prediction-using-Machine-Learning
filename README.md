# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to build a predictive model that can detect the presence of heart disease based on clinical features such as age, sex, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and more.

# 📌 Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has heart disease (1) or not (0) using logistic regression.

# 🧠 Machine Learning:
Algorithm used: Logistic Regression

Preprocessing: Standardization (using StandardScaler)

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

# 📊 Data Visualizations:
Age Distribution of Patients

Heart Disease by Gender

Chest Pain Type vs Heart Disease

Cholesterol Levels vs Condition

Max Heart Rate vs Condition

Oldpeak (ST Depression) vs Condition

Correlation Heatmap

Pairplot of Key Features

# ⚙️ Libraries Used:
